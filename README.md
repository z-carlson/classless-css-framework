# classless-css-framework
A simple, semantic, classless CSS framework. 

This is a simple, classless CSS framework that focuses on semantic HTML elements. It's meant to help quickly create something decent looking without a lot of extra bloat. It lets you focus on creating meaningful HTML to mock up a page that looks nicer than the browser defaults. 


## TODO
- Add image and multimedia styles
- Add more inline text styles
- Add some table styles
- Consider a few more content sectioning elements
